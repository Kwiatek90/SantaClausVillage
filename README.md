# Santa Claus Village

## Introduction

This code creates a virtual Santa Claus village using python classes. It uses inheritance and class methods such as adding buildings, villagers and gifts to the village. The Village, Building, and Residents classes represent elements of the village, and the Santa Clauss and Elf classes inherit from Residents to represent characters. It also uses polymorphism by adding gifts to the toy workshop, and the elves can create new gifts using the make_gift method.
